#### Task 0: [0-binary_to_uint.c]
* Write a function that converts a binary number to an `unsigned int`
#### Task 1: [1-print_binary.c]
* Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number
#### Task 2: [2-get_bit.c]
* Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index
#### Task 3: [3-set_bit.c]
* Write a function that sets the value of a bit to `1` at a given index
#### Task 4: [4-clear_bit.c]
* Write a function that sets the value of a bit to `0` at a given index
#### Task 5: [5-flip_bits.c]
* Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another
#### Task 6 (Advanced): [100-get_endianness.c]
